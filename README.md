## About The Project

Nivaran is a comprehensive healthcare platform that leverages machine learning and deep learning to assist both doctors and the general public in diagnosing various medical conditions, including brain tumors, chest cancer, bone fractures, and diabetes. Users can simply upload medical scans or numerical data, and the platform will provide accurate predictions based on its advanced algorithms. Additionally, Nivaran offers an interactive chatbot that can locate nearby pharmacies on a map, further enhancing the user's access to healthcare resources.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Problem Statement

The healthcare system faces challenges in timely, accurate diagnoses, especially where expertise is limited. Patients struggle to navigate care, and doctors may struggle to identify conditions with limited information. Traditional methods are often time-consuming, costly, and unreliable, leading to delayed treatment and suboptimal outcomes.
