## About The Project

Sunscope is a user-friendly platform designed to simplify solar energy adoption for households. By leveraging satellite imagery from Google Earth or Google Maps, users can easily upload images of their rooftops. Using our trained YOLO v11 model, Sunscope automatically annotates the rooftop and calculates the available surface area. Based on this, the platform estimates the number of solar panels that can be installed. Additionally, users can input their monthly electricity bills to receive personalized insights on potential annual savings from solar energy. Sunscope aims to reduce electricity costs, promote sustainability, and enhance awareness about the benefits of solar power

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Problem Statement

Many households face high electricity bills, especially during summer, due to limited use of solar energy. Despite the benefits of solar power, such as reducing electricity costs and supporting sustainability, users often struggle with the complexity of determining how many solar panels can fit on their roof and how much they could save. A lack of knowledge and awareness about solar energy adoption further hinders their ability to make informed decisions.





<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Key Features ðŸ¤–
- Simplified and user frirendly UI

   - We have provided a simple page to upload the rooftop image and to enter the monhtly electricity bill
